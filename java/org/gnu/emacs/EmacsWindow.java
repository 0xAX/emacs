  /* Mouse and touch event handling.

     Android does not conceptually distinguish between mouse events
     (those coming from a device whose movement affects the on-screen
     pointer image) and touch screen events.  Each click or touch
     starts a single pointer gesture sequence, and subsequent motion
     of the device will result in updates being reported relative to
     that sequence until the mouse button or touch is released.

     When a touch, click, or pointer motion takes place, several kinds
     of event can be sent:

     ACTION_DOWN or ACTION_POINTER_DOWN is sent with a new coordinate
     and an associated ``pointer ID'' identifying the event and its
     gesture sequence when a click or touch takes place.  Emacs is
     responsible for recording both the position and pointer ID of
     this click for the purpose of determining future changes to its
     position.

     ACTION_UP or ACTION_POINTER_UP is sent with a pointer ID when the
     click associated with a previous ACTION_DOWN event is released.

     ACTION_CANCEL (or ACTION_POINTER_UP with FLAG_CANCELED) is sent
     if a similar situation transpires: the window system has chosen
     to grab the click, and future changes to its position will no
     longer be reported to Emacs.

     ACTION_MOVE is sent if a coordinate tied to a click that has not
     been released changes.  Emacs processes this event by comparing
     each of the coordinates within the event with its recollection of
     those contained within prior ACTION_DOWN and ACTION_MOVE events;
     the pointer ID of the differing coordinate is then reported
     within a touch or pointer motion event along with its new
     position.

     The events described above are all sent for both touch and mouse
     click events.  Determining whether an ACTION_DOWN event is
     associated with a button event is performed by inspecting the
     mouse button state associated with that event.  If it contains
     any mouse buttons that were not contained in the button state at
     the time of the last ACTION_DOWN or ACTION_UP event, the
     coordinate contained within is assumed to be a mouse click,
     leading to it and associated motion or ACTION_UP events being
     reported as mouse button or motion events.  Otherwise, those
     events are reported as touch screen events, with the touch ID set
     to the pointer ID.

     In addition to the events illustrated above, Android also sends
     several other types of event upon select types of activity from a
     mouse device:

     ACTION_HOVER_MOVE is sent with the coordinate of the mouse
     pointer if it moves above a frame prior to any click taking
     place.  Emacs sends a mouse motion event containing the
     coordinate.

     ACTION_HOVER_ENTER and ACTION_HOVER_LEAVE are respectively sent
     when the mouse pointer enters and leaves a frame.  Moreover,
     ACTION_HOVER_LEAVE events are sent immediately before an
     ACTION_DOWN event associated with a mouse click.  These
     extraneous events are distinct in that their button states always
     contain an additional button compared to the button state
     recorded at the time of the last ACTION_UP event.

     On Android 6.0 and later, ACTION_BUTTON_PRESS is sent with the
     coordinate of the mouse pointer if a mouse click occurs,
     alongside a ACTION_DOWN event.  ACTION_BUTTON_RELEASE is sent
     with the same information upon a mouse click being released, also
     accompanying an ACTION_UP event.

     However, both types of button events are implemented in a buggy
     fashion and cannot be used to report button events.  */
