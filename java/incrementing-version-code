; This file contains an Android version code
; (https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning#versioningsettings)
; corresponding to the current Emacs version.
;
; The version code in AndroidManifest.xml.in is hard-coded to a fixed
; value, to make package downgrades possible.  Where an incrementing
; version code is required (for example, for automated F-Droid package
; builds (https://f-droid.org/packages/org.gnu.emacs/)), the version
; code in this file should be referred to and patched in to
; AndroidManifest.xml.
