# emacs-which-key
Rewrite of guide-key-mode for emacs. 

It's very rough right now. 

Planned features:
  1. Simplify code, especially the trigger mechanism to make it less resource
     intensive than guide-key.
  2. Add option to replace descriptions of keys on the fly.
  3. Switch from using popwin to window-purpose.
